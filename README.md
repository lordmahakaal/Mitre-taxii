# Mitre-taxii

<b>Introduction</b>

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive network threat detection and analysis system that combines various data sources, including network logs, external threat intelligence feeds, and STIX/TAXII threat data. This system aims to detect and analyze suspicious network activity, map detected threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, identify associated threat actors, and provide guidance for response and mitigation. The system incorporates OpenAI's GPT-3 for providing explanations and guidance in response to detected threats.
Capabilities:
* Multi-Source Data Integration: The system integrates data from diverse sources, including network logs, STIX/TAXII threat data, and external threat intelligence feeds.
* Threat Detection: It is capable of detecting a wide range of suspicious network activities, such as unauthorized access attempts and unusual data exfiltration.
* MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: The system can map detected threats to specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing a standardized framework for threat analysis.
* Threat Actor Identification: It identifies threat actors associated with the detected techniques using STIX/TAXII threat data.
* Visualization: The system generates graphical representations of detected threats using Matplotlib for better data visualization.
* AI-Powered Guidance: Through OpenAI's GPT-3 integration, the system provides explanations and guidance to cybersecurity professionals for effective incident response and mitigation.






<b>Installation</b>

Before using the system, follow these installation steps:
* Install the required Python libraries. You can use pip for this purpose.
*      pip install pandas matplotlib openai stix2 taxii2client

* Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
* Download any necessary external data sources or feeds (if not specified in the code) and place them in the appropriate directories.



<b>Usage</b>


* Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:
* Prepare your network logs and external threat intelligence feeds.
* Configure the path to your network logs in the code by updating the file path ('/var/log/appfirewall.log').
* STIX/TAXII Integration:
* Replace 'YOUR_STIX_TAXII_URL' in the code with the actual TAXII feed URL you want to use.
* STIX Indicator Creation:
* Review and modify the attributes in the create_stix_indicator function to represent the specific threat you are interested in.
* Network Threat Detection:
* Define your list of suspicious network activity patterns in the detect_network_threats function.
* Running the Code:
* Execute the main Python script to start the threat detection and analysis process.
* Interacting with GPT-3:
* To get guidance and explanations, use the GPT-3 interaction function by providing relevant queries.
* Run the script

<b>Methodology</b>

Analyzes network logs for suspicious patterns.Identifies potential threats, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual data exfiltration.Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK:Maps detected threats to specific techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.Establishes a connection between real-world threats and standardized tactics and techniques.Finding Threat Actors:Queries the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify threat actors associated with the mapped techniques.Provides insights into potential adversaries.Visualizing Threats:Uses Matplotlib to create graphical representations of detected threats.Offers a visual overview of threat patterns and their occurrences.GPT-3 Interaction:Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language interaction.Provides explanations and guidance based on detected threats and associated techniques.Fetching Threat Intelligence:Retrieves data from specified STIX/TAXII Threat Intelligence Feeds.Enhances analysis with up-to-date threat indicators.





<b>Results</b>

Detection of network threats and their visualization in graphical form.Mapping of threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.Identification of associated threat actors.GPT-3-powered explanations and guidance for handling threats.Retrieval of threat intelligence data from specified feeds.Access to the MITRE ATT&CK scripts repository for additional resources.Conclusion:This cybersecurity analysis script provides a powerful tool for enhancing network security. By combining threat detection, MITRE ATT&CK framework integration, threat actor identification, GPT-3 interaction, and access to external threat intelligence feeds and resources, it empowers cybersecurity professionals to stay proactive in defending against cyber threats. Continuous development and customization can further tailor the script to meet specific organizational needs, making it a valuable asset in the fight againstÂ cybercrime.
